# Machine Learning Project: Network Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)

## Overview
This project aims to develop a robust Intrusion Detection System (IDS) leveraging machine learning algorithms to detect malicious activities in network traffic. The project compares two main approaches for intrusion detection: signature-based detection and anomaly-based detection. It employs both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques.

## Project Structure
The project follows the CRISP-DM methodology and consists of the following main phases:

1. **Business Understanding**: Introduction to IDS and project objectives.
2. **Data Understanding**: Exploration and visualization of the dataset, and identification of different types of attacks (DoS, U2R, R2L, Probe).
3. **Data Preparation**: Data cleaning, encoding categorical features, feature selection, and scaling.
4. **Modeling**: Implementation of various machine learning models including KNN, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression.
5. **Evaluation**: Evaluation of the models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and comparison of individual models.
6. **Deployment**: Deployment of the trained model using Flask and React for a web-based application interface.
